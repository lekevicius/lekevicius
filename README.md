### I design and build digital things.

Previously I co-founded [Lemon Labs](http://lemonlabs.co) app design and development agency, worked as head of product design at [Treatwell](https://www.treatwell.co.uk) and created [Infinite Loop game](https://loopgame.co). Now, building new things and seeing where it leads me.

Now 29 years old, living in Vilnius, Lithuania. I have been designing and developing for close to 15 years, and hold a BA degree in Graphic Design from Vilnius Academy of Arts.

Currently I am independently designing and building new apps, trying to create something both useful and delightful.
